HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.












HTML elements are represented by tags.

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document

The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.


The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is:

<!DOCTYPE html>















The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page

The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page


 <meta charset="UTF-8">
 Definition and Usage
The charset attribute specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.

The HTML5 specification encourages web developers to use the UTF-8 character set, which covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world! 
and all most all the browsers support it.














<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

What is The Viewport?
The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.

The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for web pages to have a static design and a fixed size.

Then, when we started surfing the internet using tablets and mobile phones, fixed size web pages were too large to fit the viewport. To fix this, browsers on those devices scaled down the entire web page to fit the screen.

This was not perfect!! But a quick fix.

Setting The Viewport

HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the <meta> tag.

You should include the following <meta> viewport element in all your web pages:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

Size Content to The Viewport
Users are used to scroll websites vertically on both desktop and mobile devices - but not horizontally!

So, if the user is forced to scroll horizontally, or zoom out, to see the whole web page it results in a poor user experience.










<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

The REL attribute is used to define the relationship between the linked file and the HTML document. REL=StyleSheet specifies a persistent or preferred style while REL="Alternate StyleSheet" defines an alternate style











The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.




















    What is an HTML Element?
    An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
    
    <tagname> example.. </tagname>
    The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
    
    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
    Start tag	Element content	End tag
    <h1>	My First Heading	</h1>
    <p>	My first paragraph.	</p>
    <br>	none	none
    Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!


Web Browsers
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.




















HTML body Structure:

header (navigation) , content , footer

Note: The content inside the <body> section will be displayed in a browser. The content inside the <title> element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.












    Boilerplate code in HTML is a prepared library of code that can be copied and used as a starting point to start building web projects. It is sometimes referred to as an HTML starter template, HTML framework, HTML skeleton, or HTML foundation.
