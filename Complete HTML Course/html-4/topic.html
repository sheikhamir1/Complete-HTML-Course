HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.


Example

<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>

Note: Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a heading.





Headings Are Important
Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.


Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.


<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.

Note: Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.


Bigger Headings
Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:



Global Attributes
The <h1> to <h6> tags also supports the Global Attributes in HTML.
The global attributes are attributes that can be used with all HTML elements.



Event Attributes
The <h1> to <h6> tags also supports the Event Attributes in HTML.
    
   
HTML has the ability to let events trigger actions in a browser, like starting a JavaScript when a user clicks on an element.


Window Event Attributes
Form Events Attributes
Keyboard Events Attributes
Mouse Events Attributes
Drag Events Attributes

The H1 tag is the HTML tag used to create the main title on a webpage (i.e., the H1 or heading one). It contains an opening <h1> tag, the title text, and a closing </h1> tag. The H1 is usually the most prominent text on a page, allowing visitors to quickly learn what the page is about.


H1s Improve User Experience

H1s Improve Accessibility
H1 tags (and other headings in general) can help those who use screen readers due to visual impairments understand the pageâ€™s content.
